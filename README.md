# Projection-based-PC-Quality-Metric
<b>Introduction</b>
<p>A novel joint geometry and color projection-based point cloud objective quality metric which solves the critical weakness of this type of quality metrics, i.e., the misalignment between the reference and degraded projected images. Moreover, this point cloud quality metric exploits the best performing 2D quality metrics in the literature to assess the quality of the projected images.</p>
<b>Installation Instructions</b>
<p>Image Quality Assessment (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/IQA-pytorch/">IQA</a>) Models in PyTorch should be installed</p>
